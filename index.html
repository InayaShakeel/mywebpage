   <h2> this book series is one of my all time favourites! its about two school girls, Daisy Wells and Hazel Wong, and about all of the muder cases they have solved together. Robin Stevens, a british author, wrote the 10 books. the books give me a roller coaster of emotions and there are many twists and turns in the plots of each book. they are all so similar but diffetrent so you dont get bored a nd so it is not predictabel! i loved these books and i rate them a 10/10.
 
    <h1> Harry Potter </h1>

    <h2> this book series is very good (again, one of my favourites) but is a little bit predictable. they are about a lonely boy who finds out a wizard and enrolls in Hogwarts, a school of witch craft and wizardry. Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal,and in the end, Harry finally defeates him. i loved this story as it was very intruiging and i wanted to know what happened next. as i said before, it is a little bit predictable so i would rate it a 7/10
    
    <h1> Percy Jackson </h1>
