   <h2> this book series is one of my all time favourites! its about two school girls, Daisy Wells and Hazel Wong, and about all of the muder cases they have solved together. Robin Stevens, a british author, wrote the 10 books. the books give me a roller coaster of emotions and there are many twists and turns in the plots of each book. they are all so similar but diffetrent so you dont get bored a nd so it is not predictabel! i loved these books and i rate them a 10/10.
